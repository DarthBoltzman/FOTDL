Go reading on the previous attempt to harness the dragon's power in this area

Several hundred years ago, blue dragon tried to take the energy left over and concentrate it against the metallic
dragons. Took 3 metallic dragons, bronze, silver, gold to prevent him from taking over the island. Bronze countered
lighting ability, silver/gold provided additional power. Took these 3 fighting together to defeat the blue dragon.
Trying to conduct this from the clifftop observatory. When they stopped him there was a brazier that could be worked
with to balance the lighting energy (absorb/calm). Find another section that indicates the brazier can only be lit with
dragon fire. **Must be some way to get portable dragon fire.**
