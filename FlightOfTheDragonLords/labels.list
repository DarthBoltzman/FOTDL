    <secondary-label id="class_artificer" name="Artificer">
        Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They
        see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can
        find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of
        tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a
        potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary
        charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce
        the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

    <secondary-label id="class_barbarian" name="Barbarian">
        Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More
        than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's
        fury, and a sea's turmoil.
        Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to
        the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own
        deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny
        reflexes and heightened senses.
        Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those
        under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for
        adventure.

    <secondary-label id="class_bar" name="Bard">
        Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts,
        disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that
        remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts
        to harness those words, which transcend any language.
        Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of
        many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.
        A Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences,
        much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

    <secondary-label id="class_cleric" name="Cleric">
        Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon,
        or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and
        channel it to bolster people and battle foes.
        Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity
        or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training,
        yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.
        Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service,
        carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the
        gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_druid" name="Druid" color="tangerine">
        Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and
        the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.
        Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they
        typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural
        cycles.
        Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need
        for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled
        nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the
        threat.

    <secondary-label id="class_fighter" name="Fighter">
        Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as
        Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with
        death, both meting it out and defying it.
        Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any
        combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of
        familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting
        with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad
        ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_monk" name="Monk">
        Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their
        internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life
        force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler
        manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.
        Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed
        and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic
        weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.
        Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus
        they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life
        helps to fuel their determination and discipline.
        Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire
        to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn
        themselves into living weapons.

    <secondary-label id="class_mystic" name="Mystic">
        A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained
        on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their
        smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly
        cudgel.
        The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and
        surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity.
        Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run,
        never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.
        Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with
        blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When
        the duke's men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling
        with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.
        These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to
        turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning
        to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret.
        Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into
        living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_paladin" name="Paladin">
        Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn
        before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
        dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout
        warrior into a blessed champion.
        Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial
        skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect
        the helpless and those who fight at their side.
        Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines
        of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world's armies, but
        even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn
        from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

    <secondary-label id="class_ranger" name="Ranger">
        Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their
        unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily
        through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
        Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the
        wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of
        monsters and tyrants.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_rogue" name="Rogue">
        Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They
        have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement
        their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in
        a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.
        In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than
        wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.
        Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue's
        relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest
        Rogues.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_sorcerer" name="Sorcerer">
        Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their
        power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or
        a dryad at a baby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too
        might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the
        inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning
        magic that can be passed down through generations.
        Sorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is
        learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to
        unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing
        distinct powers that reflect its source.
        Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time,
        the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn't like
        to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded.
    </secondary-label>
    <secondary-label id="class_warlock" name="Warlock">
        Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for
        magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of
        extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each
        Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as
        angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane
        secrets to bolster their own power.
        Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect,
        revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their
        patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.
        Once a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks
        spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

    <secondary-label id="class_wizard" name="Wizard">
        Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire,
        arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other
        planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one
        substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
        Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic,
        particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha,
        Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.
        The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell
        their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.
        But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and
        laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient
        civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock
        the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.
